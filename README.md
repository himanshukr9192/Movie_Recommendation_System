# Movie_Recommendation_System
A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity with the TMDB Dataset

Overview: This repository contains a Python-based application that utilizes the TMDB Movie Metadata dataset to recommend similar movies based on user input. The system employs cosine similarity for calculating movie similarity and provides users with five movie recommendations.

Methodology: The recommendation system uses a Content-Based Model and a Collaborative Filtering Model to filter and predict movies that a user would like, based on individual data provided by the user.

Implementation: The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development using Python and relevant libraries.
